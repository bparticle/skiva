**About**

Skiva is a circle based icon theme designed for the GNOME 3 desktop on Ubuntu, but they can be used on any debian based desktop environment. It is a work in progress that so far consists of the main Ubuntu folder icons and 19 application icons, but icons are added frequently. I decided to share this personal project with the community in order to get some feedback and encouragement for further development. Inspiration I have drawn from Malyss' Uniblack theme you can find here http://malysss.deviantart.com/art/malys-uniblack-update-11-09-2012-301085946. Uniblack is a wonderful icon theme, but I found the application icons hard to use due to their uniformity in color and style. 

Skiva is a project that aims to bring a comprehensive circle based icon theme with color and character to the Ubuntu desktop and beyond.

**Installation**

On Ubuntu install it by extracting the zip file or cloning the repository in ~/.local/share/icons/, or in /usr/share/icons/
